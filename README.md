# Events Insights Project In Google Sheets
## Overview
This project involved building a dynamic and visually engaging dashboard in Google Sheets to track and analyze attendance across multiple music events. The dashboard provides real-time insights into performance metrics like city-wise turnout, singer popularity, and unique sponsors.
The result was a fully functional, interactive system that allows stakeholders to understand attendance trends across locations and performers using Google Sheets' built-in tools and functions.
## Data Source
The dataset was manually created to simulate real-world event attendance data. It includes fictional entries for cities, singers, sponsors, sales, gender distribution, and event dates to demonstrate data analysis and dashboard-building skills in Google Sheets.
## Tools Used
-	Google Sheets
Used for building the entire dashboard, including raw data organization, formulas, and visualizations.
-	Google Sheets Charts
Bar charts and scorecards were used to visualize city-wise and singer-wise attendance.
-	Google Sheets Functions
Key functions:
•	UNIQUE()
•	COUNTA()
•	FILTER()
•	TEXT()
•	MONTH()
## Data cleaning
Data cleaning: Before building the dashboard, I performed basic data cleaning in Google Sheets to ensure accuracy and consistency in the analysis. Key steps included:
•	Removing Blank Rows & Columns
Cleared out any empty or unnecessary rows to maintain a clean dataset.
•	Handling Duplicates
Used the UNIQUE() function to identify and manage duplicate entries in fields like Singer and Sponsor.
•	Standardizing Text Formats
Ensured consistent formatting for categorical data (e.g., city names, singer names) to avoid mismatches due to extra spaces or case differences.
•	Date Formatting
Converted all date entries into a standard date format to enable correct month extraction and time-based analysis.
## Analysis techniques
I used Descriptive Analysis to summarize and visualize event attendance data. Key techniques included aggregating totals, counting unique values, comparing categories with bar charts, and extracting months from dates to identify trends.
## Visualizations used
The final output was a clean, interactive Google Sheets dashboard.
The charts used were bar charts, column charts, area charts, scorecards and slicers.
## Key Insights
-	Top-Performing Singers:
Certain singers consistently attract higher attendance, indicating stronger fan engagement or marketing effectiveness.
-	Most Active Cities:
A few cities stand out with significantly higher event attendance, suggesting strategic locations for future events or promotions.
-	Increasing or Stable Attendance Trends:
The data shows how attendance changes across different events or months, helping spot peak periods and seasonal demand.
-	Gender Distribution:
The male-to-female attendance ratio provides insights into audience demographics and can guide more targeted outreach.
-	Sponsor Involvement:
A variety of sponsors are linked with the events, and tracking the number of unique sponsors helps evaluate brand participation and diversity.
-	Date-Based Insights:
Month-based analysis helps identify which times of year see higher engagement, supporting better scheduling for future events.
## Challenges and learnings
I faced some challenges and learned a lot while working on this project and the problems and learnings were as follows; 
•	Setting up formulas and charts to automatically update as new data is added required careful use of open-ended ranges, along with FILTER and UNIQUE functions. 
•	Customizing visualizations for a cleaner dashboard layout led to temporary confusion when hidden axis labels needed to be restored, solved through proper axis formatting.
•	Choosing the right visualizations while keeping the dashboard simple but insightful was a key design decision.
•	Discovered how to creatively use scorecard charts in Google Sheets to show key metrics, a useful alternative to tools like Excel or Power BI in lightweight use cases.
•	Gained experience in documenting the project for a portfolio, which will help in creating reusable templates for future dashboard builds.
## Conclusion
This project demonstrates how Google Sheets can be effectively used to create a dynamic and insightful dashboard for tracking event attendance data. From data cleaning and formula-driven automation to meaningful visualizations, every element was designed to provide clear, actionable insights.
The dashboard not only highlights key metrics like top-performing cities and artists but also enables ongoing analysis as new data is added without the need for manual updates. Through this project, I strengthened my skills in spreadsheet automation, data visualization, and dashboard structuring, and built a reusable framework for similar data analysis tasks in the future.
